<h1>Description</h1>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify"> I have a Master degree on quantum information and quantum optics physics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)
  and physicist at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia with experience in research that combined studies with working
  and other commitments. Seeking opportunities to apply the skills obtained through my career. I'm interested in software development, 
  Machine Learning, and data analysis aiming at combining background, research experience, and skills for new projects. <br><br>
	 
  Solid knowledge in theoretical physics such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, quantum optics, and quantum information theory  
  among others, and sufficient on programming on different languages such as Python and C++. 
  Very good working in group as well as developing projects on my own. Particularly passionate about teaching. 
  All without leaving aside daily activities that also interest me like sports, chess, dance, and meeting new people.</p>
